The goal of this project was to implement a simplified version of Black Jack card game using Ruby.

To use, clone the git repository and run with ruby.

The game has a terminal interface. To select an option you input its index into the terminal window.

This is a learning project for an online ruby course Thinknetica. https://thinknetica.com/
